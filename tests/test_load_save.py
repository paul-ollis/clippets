"""Loading and saving the clippets file.

The clippets file contains a mixture of the following:

Comments
    Any unindented line that starts with a hash ('#').

One-off directives.
    Any unindented line that starts with the 'at' ('@') symbol. The currently
    recognised directives are:

    @title: <text>

Group plus tag names
    Any non-indended line that is not a comment. Tag names appear after the
    group name and within brackts ('[' and ']'). Tags are separated by spaces.
    The file format is basically flat, but colons (':') may be used to indicate
    nested groups. For example 'Main:Sub' defines a group 'Sub' that is a child
    of the group 'Main'.

Element start markers
    An indented line starting and ending with 'at' ('@') symbols.
    The current valid markers are:

    @keywords@
        The content is split into a set of (white space separated) keywords.
    @md@
        The content is treated as Markdown text.
    @text@
        The content is treated as  plain text.

Content
    Indented or blank lines that follow a start marker.

Uninterpreted
    Any other lines.

All content, including comments and uninterpreted text is stored during
loading and stored as a nested tree of groups.

Wahe a (possibly modified) tree is saved, the output should always be a close
analogue of the original input. There will be some notable differences.

- Indentation of markers and content will be 2 and 4 spaces respectively.
- All keywords within a group get written at the start of the group and they
  are sorted before writing.
