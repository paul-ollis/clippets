# Introduction

Clippets was developed to support people such as teachers who often find they
make the same comments many times when marking student papers.

Clippets reads the input file, which defines a tree of groups of text snippets,
and allows you to arrange one or more into the clipboard. This provides a
convenient way to quickly build up common pieces of text, ready to paste into a
different program.

Clippets allows you to add and modify snippets, saving each such change back to
the input file. Up to 10 backups of the original input file are also kept.

Each snippet may be plain text or may use Markdown formatting. Markdown formatted
text is converted to HTML before being placed in the clipboard. Programs such as
Word and LibreOffice will intelligently interpret such HTML, preserving italics,
bold, bulleted lists, *etc*.


# Keyboard and mouse control summary

Clippets allows control using both the mouse and the keyboard. This is a summary
of the keyboard controls. Where appropriate, mouse based alternatives are
indicated.

## Normal mode keys

**F1**
    Display this help. Press F1 again to return to *normal mode*.

**F2**
    Edit the contents of the clipboard. This allows you to 'tweak' the text
    before you paste it into another program.  Such edits will be lost if you
    add or remove another snippet, but you can use *Ctrl+U* to get them back.

**F3**
    Remove all snippets from the clipboard.

**F7**
    Edit the keywords of the group containing the selected snippet.

**F8**
    Toggle the order of snippets in the clipboard between ``order added`` and
    ``order within snippet tree``.

**F9**
    Collapse (close) all the groups if any group is not currently collapsed. If
    all the groups are already collapsed then open them all.

**a**
    Add a snippet new snippet; opened in the editor. The new snippet is added
    below any currently selected snippet or, if a group is selected, the
    snippet becomes the first in the group.

    [Mouse: Right click the snippet and then select the 'Add' button.]

**d**
    Duplicate the currently selected snippet and then edit the copy.

    [Mouse: Right click the snippet and then select the 'Duplicate' button.]

**e**
    Edit the contents of the currently selected snippet.

    [Mouse: Right click the snippet and then select the 'Edit' button.]

**f, Ins**
    Collapse or open the selected group (or group containing the selected snippet).

    [Mouse: Left click on the group label.]

**m**
    Start moving the currently selected snippet. This switches Clippets to
    the *snippet movement mode*.

    [Mouse: Right click the snippet and then select the 'Move' button. Or
    Alt+Right click the snippet.]

**Enter (Return), Space**
    If the selected snippet is already in the clipboard, remove it. Otherwise
    append the snippet to clipboard contents list. The preview window near the
    top of the UI is updated accordingly.

    [Mouse: Left click on a snippet.]

**Up, Down**
    If the filter field currently has focus then the exit filter field.
    Otherwise move the selection to the previous or next snippet/group.

**Left**
    If a snippet is selected, moves the selection into the group headings.

**Right**
    If a group heading is selected and it has at least one visible snippet, move
    the selection into that group's snippets.

**Ctrl+B**
    Clears (Blanks) the filter field's contents.

**Ctrl+F, Tab**
    Toggle the focus to or away from the filter field at the top of the display.
    See (TBD) for how this is used.

    [Mouse: Left click the field to give it focus.]

**Ctrl+Q**
    Exit Clippets.

**Ctrl+U, Ctrl+R**
