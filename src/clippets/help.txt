# Introduction

Clippets was developed to support people such as teachers who often find they
make the same comments many times when marking student papers.

Clippets reads the input file, which defines a tree of groups of text snippets,
and allows you to arrange one or more into the clipboard. This provides a
convenient way to quickly build up common pieces of text, ready to paste into a
different program.

Clippets allows you to add and modify snippets, saving each such change back to
the input file. Up to 10 backups of the original input file are also kept.

Each snippet may be plain text or may use Markdown formatting. Markdown formatted
text is converted to HTML before being placed in the clipboard. Programs such as
Word and LibreOffice will intelligently interpret such HTML, preserving italics,
bold, bulleted lists, *etc*.
