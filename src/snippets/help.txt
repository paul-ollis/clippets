# Introduction

Snippets was developed to support ppeople such as teachers who often find they
make the same comments many times when marking student papers.

Snippets reads the input file, which defeins a tree of groups of text snippets,
any allows you to arrange one or more into the clipboard. This provides a
convient way to quickly build up common pieces of text, ready to paste into a
different program.

Snippets allows you to add and modify snippets, saving each such change back to
the input file. Up to 9 backups of the original input file are also kept.

Each snippet may be plain text or may use Markdown formatting. Mardown formatted
text is converted to HTML before being placed in the clipboard. Programs such as
Word and LibreOffice will intelligently interpret such HTML, preserving italics,
bold, bulletted lists, *etc*.


# Keyboard and mouse control summary

Snippets allows control using both the mouse and the keyboard. This is a summary
of the keyboard controls. Where appropriate, mouse base alteratives are
indicated.

# File format details.

A snippets file contains a mixture of the following:

Comments
    Any unindented line that starts with a hash ('#').

One-off directives
    Any unindented line that starts with the '@' symbol. The currently
    recognised directives are::

        @title: <text>

Group plus tag names
    Any non-indended *line* that is not a comment. Tag names appear after the
    group name and within brackts ('[' and ']'). Tags are separated by
    spaces. The file format is basically flat, but colons (':') may be used
    to indicate nested groups. For example::

        Main                                  .- Main
            ...                               |  `- Sub
        Main:Sub             --->             |- Secondary
            ...                               :
        Secondary
            ...

Element start markers
    An indented line starting and ending with '@' symbols. The current valid
    markers are::

        @keywords@
        @md@
        @text@

Content
    Indented or blank lines that follow a start marker.

Uninterpreted
    Any other lines.
