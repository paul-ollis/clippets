Running clippets/snippets
-------------------------

Clippets needs a file to hold your snippets, here we assume is it called
``snippets.txt``. Run clippets as one of the following commands:

.. code-block::

   snippets snippets.txt
   clippets snippets.txt

The first time you run this command Clippets will offer to create the file and
will populate it with some place-holder snippets. The ``F1`` key will bring up
a help screen to get you going.
