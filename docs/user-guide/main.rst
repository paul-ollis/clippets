    - A good link for basic Markdown.

..  Things we cannot do.

    - Add a snippet of a given type / change snippet type.
    - Use simple text search in the filter field.
    - Should re-gaining focus update the clipboard.
    - Snippet ordering should be shown next to the clipboard widget.
    - Consider something different to ``Ctrl-Q`` for quitting the editor.
    - I think that 'added snippet highlighting' disappears after using the
      internal editor on the clipboard. This appears deliberate, but feels
      counter-intuitive.
    - When all groups are folded, the 'right' key moves off the selected group,
      which should not be allowed.
    - Snippet moving does not cope with collapsed groups.
